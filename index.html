/* TODO

x 3d canvas, basic webgl setup
x simple mesh triangulation of a heightmap function
x arcball viewing
 x view matrix
 x drag/touch to change angles
  x accumulate angles
x lighting and colours
o New plan
 o Height map becomes surface map with basis vectors and curvature.
 o Then take a sample grid and perturb it based on curvature and feature detection (and tool size/shape?)
 o Then generate vector field and join up into tool path.
 o Then triangulate toolpath to give renderable mesh.
! Return surface info at each 2D point, not just height:
x Rename height module
x Rename: tangent->cutDir, cotangent to perpDir
x Return basis and curvature for cube
x tests
x Visualise cut direction vector field
 x Add arrow heads
x Refactor out duplication in draw* modules
 x Shader loading etc
 x Buffer setup
 x Camera module
x Pinch to move camera in/out
 x touch module should export pan / pinch etc events directly (ie touch.pan not touch.start/move etc)
 x Proper multitouch handling
 x Pinch zoom
x Return basis and curvature for sphere
x Translate
x Sweep
 o Takes a profile and a path
 o For each point, find the line-of-profile
 x Height from profile evaluation on line-of-profile
 x CutDir from path
 x Perp from profile gives the normal
 x CutCurvature from profile
 x PerpCurvature from path
 x lerp needs to min/max. curvature hw/hh are wrong way round
x Numerical tests for normal and curvatures
 x Normal test
 x Fix ellipse normal
 x Curvature test
 x Fix ellipse curvature
 x Fix sphere cut curvature!
x Sweep takes another arg giving the scale of the profile along the path
x Break primitives.js out into appropriate modules
x Path tests at the seam underneath the sweep function
x Scaling along the path _should_ change the cutDir
x cutdir is 2D
x Remove normal and curvatures; these should becalculated later
x Bring in bezier.js
x Set up a bezier path function
x ! power(0): cutdir does not curve round end caps !! SHOULD NOT BE ANY END CAPS!
x Unit tests for bezier
x Simple toolpath generation: simple criss/cross for now
 x Toolpath module
 x Return Array of toolpath points
  x Stub array for now
  x Cutlines from toolpath
 x Generate criss-cross toolpath for actual surface
* Resurrect old surface/cutdir rendering as a surface visualisation aid
 * Calculate normals for rendering
  * Take numerical normal/curvature calcs out of tests into triangulation
 * cutDir visualisation
* GCode generation from toolpath
 * Button to export
 * Save a file
 * Generate GCode from toolpath
* Generate tool path that follows surface features
 * Property tests
* ? cutdir is same all the way across the profile section; it should surely turn in less near the centreline? ?? Is this true?
* Modify sampling of toolpath: Coalesce samples that have low curvature
 * Property tests
* Add samples where curvature is high
 * Property tests
* Find discontinuities and increase sampling(?)
 * Property tests
* Two finger drag to pan
